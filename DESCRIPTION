Description: Solve stochastic differential equations via Euler-Maruyama, Milstein,
        and Runge-Kutta2 methods. The EM scheme is implemented for Ito processes, exponential
         Ito-Levy processes, two-dimensional systems of correlated SDEs, and finally arbitrary systems
         of independent SDEs or SDEs all driven by the same Brownian motion.
